# Spam_Email_Detection
Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning with Python

The project is about building a spam email prediction system using machine learning and logistic regression in Python. 
It involves advanced text analysis techniques like TF-IDF and NLP features, along with HTML parsing to extract meaningful content from email messages. 

The code reads a dataset containing emails and their categories, preprocesses the data by removing HTML tags, replaces categories with numerical labels, splits the data, and extracts features using TF-IDF with n-grams. 
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the features and evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report. 

The project demonstrates how to effectively identify spam emails while considering their actual content, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
